## 🎨 Photography Tips

### General Guidelines
- **Lighting**: Natural light is best, shoot near windows
- **Background**: Clean, simple backgrounds (white, wood, marble)
- **Angle**: Slight overhead angle (45°) works great for food
- **Props**: Add minimal props (napkin, coffee cup, herbs)
- **Focus**: Sharp focus on the main item, slight blur on background

### Food Styling Tips
- **Fresh is best**: Photograph items fresh from oven when possible
- **Show texture**: Capture crust, crumb, layers, and toppings
- **Cross sections**: For breads/cakes, show one sliced to reveal interior
- **Steam**: If possible, capture steam from fresh-baked items
- **Garnish**: Add fresh herbs, flour dusting, or fruit for color

### Quick Wins
1. **Use your smartphone** - Modern phones take excellent photos
2. **Golden hour** - Shoot in morning or late afternoon for best light
3. **Consistency** - Use similar lighting/styling across all photos
4. **Edit lightly** - Slightly boost contrast and saturation, but keep natural
5. **Compress** - Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh to optimize file sizes

## 📱 Free Stock Photo Resources (Alternative)

If you need temporary photos while waiting for professional shots:
- **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - Free high-quality photos
- **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Free stock photos
- **Pixabay** (pixabay.com) - Free images

Search terms: "artisan bread", "bakery", "croissant", "sourdough", "pastry chef", "bakery interior"

## ⚡ After Replacing Images

1. Save images in the exact paths listed above
2. Optimize images for web (use tools like Squoosh.app)
3. Keep original high-res versions for print/marketing
4. Test website on mobile to ensure images load quickly

## 🎯 Priority Order

If doing photos gradually, prioritize in this order:
1. **Hero image** - First thing visitors see
2. **Top 3 menu items** - Sourdough, croissant, chocolate cake
3. **About image** - Build trust with team/baker photo
4. **Remaining menu items** - Complete the menu
5. **Feature images** - Nice to have but less critical
